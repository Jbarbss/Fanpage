<h2><strong>Bio</strong></h2>



<p class="bold">One of the most popular adult alternative rock bands of the 1990s, 
the Goo Goo Dolls rose to prominence with major hits like "Name" and "Iris," 
earning a widespread audience receptive to their mix of jangling guitar-driven 
pop and acoustic balladry. Often compared early in their career to the Replacements, 
they managed to refine and mainstream their sound, going on to sell millions of records 
to audiences largely unfamiliar with their influences. Beginning in the mid-'90s, 
the Goo Goo Dolls notched numerous Top Ten singles, peaking in popularity at the end of 
the decade, though albums like 2002's Gutterflower and 2006's Let Love In helped them 
maintain a fairly consistent chart presence before falling off somewhat in the 2010s. 
They continued to record new material while celebrating their legacy with several 
retrospectives and anniversary releases of their most prominent albums. 
After making a strong studio return with 2019's Miracle Pill, they released their 
first Christmas album in 2020.</p>

<p class="styledFont"> The Goo Goo Dolls formed in 1985 in Buffalo, New York. Guitarist/vocalist 
Johnny Rzeznik, bassist Robby Takac, and drummer George Tutuska initially banded 
together under the name the Sex Maggots -- their new moniker was chosen from an ad 
in True Detective magazine at the behest of a local club owner. Originally a cover 
band with a taste for power pop and classic rock & roll, the group soon began writing 
original songs. Their early sound recalled the Replacements' origins as a bratty punk band: 
melodic, snotty, and a little bit thrashy. That sound was the reason the band attracted the 
interest of the heavy metal label Metal Blade, which issued their debut album in 1987 
(known either as The Goo Goo Dolls or First Release). Released in 1989, the follow-up album, 
Jed, continued in a similar vein, and the band's college radio breakthrough came with 1990's 
Hold Me Up, a Replacements-ish power pop record.</p>
